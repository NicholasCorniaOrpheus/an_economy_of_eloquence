# What is this game about?

An Economy of Eloquence_ is a game about **discovery**, **plurality**, and **unexpected journeys** designed for researchers and librarians.

During a game session, the players collaboratively build a small **knowledge graph** by reconsidering their viewpoint on entities and concepts related to their research field, or the library catalogue of their institution. After each game session, a non-linear knowledge structure will emerge from the collaborative, and sometimes adversarial, effort of the player. This game encourages **collaborative research** between fellow researchers at any stage of their work, in opposition to solitary and competition-based inquiry.

We have introduced some randomness in the process to drive players outside their intellectual comfort zones, exploring the possibilities of unbeaten tracks and collaborative research.

This game could be easily adapted for introductory talks, open discussions and panel sessions during conferences, and even brainstorming. Despite the scholarly theme given to the game, it could be played by any collective of people outside academia willing to explore conversation and decision-making playfully.
